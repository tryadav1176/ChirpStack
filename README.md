# 🐦 ChirpStack - Tweet Manager with Django

ChirpStack is a simple tweet management app built with **Django**, inspired by the [Chai aur Code](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary) tutorials on YouTube and GitHub.

This project lets users **create, view, edit, and delete tweets** — a great way to understand Django’s core components like models, views, URL routing, and templates.
